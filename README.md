# ss-Linear-Noise-Approximation

Python scripts used to simulate Figure 2 of the paper "Stochastic enzyme kinetics and the quasi-steady-state reductions: 
Application of the slow scale linear noise approximation \` a la Fenichel" [arXiv, 2101.04814 (physics.chem-ph)]. All 
codes were run using Python, version 3. You can generate Figure 2 by running the driver code: GillDriver.py. This code 
was originally created by Justin Eilertsen.  For more information, we recommend to read the paper on:
